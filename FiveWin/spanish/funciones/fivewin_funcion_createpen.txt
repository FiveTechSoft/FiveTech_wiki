Creates a pen with the specified style, width & color
====== Sintaxis ======
 CreatePen( <nStyle>, <nWidth>, <nRGBColor> ) --> hPen 

 This function creates a pen having the specified style, width and color.
The pen can be subsequently be selected as the current pen for any
device. 

====== Parámetros ======


 <nStyle> Specifies the pen style. This parameter can be one of the
following values: 


  PS_SOLID      Creates a solid pen.   
  PS_DASH      Creates a dashed pen. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.) 
  PS_DOT      Creates a dotted pen. (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)   
  PS_DASHDOT      Creates a pen with alternating dashes and dots. (Valid
              only when the pen width is 1.)   
  PS_DASHDOTDOT   Creates a pen with alternating dashes and double dots.
              (Valid only when the pen width is 1.)   
  PS_NULL      Creates a null pen.   
  PS_INSIDEFRAME   Creates a pen that draws a line inside the frame of
            closed shapes produced by graphics device interface (GDI) output
            functions that specify a bounding rectangle (for example, the Ellipse,
            Rectangle, RoundRect, Pie, and Chord functions). When this style is used
            with GDI output functions that do not specify a bounding rectangle (for
            example, the LineTo function), the drawing area of the pen is not limited
            by a frame.   

 <nWidth> Specifies the width, in logical units, of the pen. If this
value is zero, the width in device units is always one pixel, regardless
of the mapping mode. 

 <nRGBColor> Specifies the color of the pen. 

====== Devuelve ======

 <hPen> The handle of the brush or 0 if it was not possible to create it.
