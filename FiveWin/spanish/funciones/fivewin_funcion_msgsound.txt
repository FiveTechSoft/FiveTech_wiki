MsgSound()

Play a Wav sound file
====== Sintaxis ======
 MsgSound( <cSndName>, <nMode> ) --> lSuccess 
====== Parámetros ======
  <cSndName>  Name of the wav file that we will reproduce. If this parameter is given as NIL,
              the possible sound that be sounding it will stop to sound. 
  <nMode>     It specifies like we want that this sound sounds. 
     SND_SYNC        0   The function doesn't finish until the sound end up. 
     SND_ASYNC       1   The function returns immediately later that the sound begins to sound. 
                         For to stop the sound will call you another time to this function
                         without parameters. 
     SND_NODEFAULT   2   If we don't find the sound, the function It doesn't execute the sound for defect. 
     SND_MEMORY      4   The parameter cSndName is a points to an in-memory image of a waveform sound. 
     SND_LOOP        8   The sound will continue sounding until let us call another time to the function
                         without parameters. We will specify as nMode also the flag SND_ASYNC to be
                         able to make loops sounds: nOr( SND_ASYNC, SND_LOOP ). 
     SND_NOSTOP     16   It prevents that there is another sound being executed in that moment.
                         If it is this way the function it returns false without playing the sound suitable. 
====== Devuelve ======
 <lSuccess> If the sound is played, the return value is .T.; otherwise it is .F. 

Observations:

 If the sound can not be found, the function plays the default sound
specified by the SystemDefault entry in the [sounds] section of the
registry. If there is no SystemDefault entry or if the default sound
can't be found, the function makes no sound and returns FALSE.
