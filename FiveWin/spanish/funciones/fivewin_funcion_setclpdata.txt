 Private data formats in the range CF_PRIVATEFIRST through CF_PRIVATELAST
are not automatically freed when the data is removed from the clipboard.
Data handles associated with these formats should be freed upon receiving
a WM_DESTROYCLIPBOARD message. 


 


 





 Private data formats in the range CF_GDIOBJFIRST through CF_GDIOBJLAST
will be automatically removed by a call to the DeleteObject function when
the data is removed from the clipboard. If Windows Clipboard is running,
it will not update its window to show the data placed in the clipboard by
the SetClipboardData until after the CloseClipboard function is called. 


 


 







 <uData> The handle of the data to place at the Clipboard. Right now
FiveWin only supports text, due not to a FiveWin limitation since that
all formats have not yet been implemented.
