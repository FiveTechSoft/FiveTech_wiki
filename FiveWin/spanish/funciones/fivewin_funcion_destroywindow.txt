DestroyWindow()

Destroys the specified window
====== Sintaxis ======
 DestroyWindow( <hWnd> ) --> lSuccess 

 The DestroyWindow function destroys the specified window. The function
sends appropriate messages to the window to deactivate it and remove the
input focus. It also destroys the window's menu, flushes the application
queue, destroys outstanding timers, removes clipboard ownership, and
breaks the clipboard-viewer chain (if the window is at the top of the
viewer chain). 

 It sends WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY messages to the window. If the
given window is the parent of any windows, DestroyWindow automatically
destroys these child windows when it destroys the parent window. The
function destroys child windows first, and then the window itself. 

 The DestroyWindow function also destroys modelessdialog boxes created by
the CreateDialog function. 

 FiveWin manages all these functions through Classes.Use FiveWin Classes
as they are much easier to use and more powerful.
