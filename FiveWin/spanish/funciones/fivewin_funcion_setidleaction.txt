 SetIdleAction( [<bIdleAction>] ) --> nil

 <bIdleAction> Is the codeblock to execute during idle periods. If no
codeblock is provided, SetIdleAction() resets the current bIdleAction, so
it stops the previous defined idle codeblock.

Observations:





 It is very important that you don't process large routines here or you
will freeze the whole system. Processes may be really, really fast !!! 


 


 


 


 Don't confuse idle periods with timers. Idle periods are those during
there are no pending messages to process. As soon as the application
starts processing messages, all idle actions get stopped.
