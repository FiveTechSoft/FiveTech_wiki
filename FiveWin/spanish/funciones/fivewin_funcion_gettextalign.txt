    TA_LEFT        0   Alignment to the left in the axis and.   
    TA_NOUPDATECP  0   Specifies that the current position is not updated.   
    TA_RIGHT       2   Alignment to the right in the axis and.   
    TA_TOP         0   Alignment of the axis x in the superior part.

Observation:

 These alone alineaciones will take effect when we use to write the
functions TextOut or ExtTextOut, not working since for the DrawText this
function has a parameter that allows their own alignment.
