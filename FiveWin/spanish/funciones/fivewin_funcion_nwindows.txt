 <nWnds> Number of windows created by our application. 

Observations:

 The windows when being created, including the dialogs, they go
increasing a called static array aWindows that it is initialized in the
class TWindow. This function us it provides the longitude of this array
in the moment in that the call takes place to this function. Although the
controls are inherited of the class TWindow these they are not part of
the array aWindows and therefore they don't count in this compute.
