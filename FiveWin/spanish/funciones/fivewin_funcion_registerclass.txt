RegisterClass()

Register a new Windows class
====== Sintaxis ======
 RegisterClass( <cClassName>, <nStyle>, <nClsExtra>, <nWndExtra>,
<hCursor>, <hBrush>, <cMenuName>, <nWndProc> ) --> lSuccess 
====== Parámetros ======
  <cClassName> Specifies the name of the new class 
  <nStyle>     Specifies the class style. These styles can be combined by
               using the bitwise OR operator. This can be any combination of the
               following values: 

           Value            Meaning    
           CS_BYTEALIGNCLIENT   Aligns the client area of a window on the byte 
                                boundary (in the x-direction).   
           CS_BYTEALIGNWINDOW   Aligns a window on the byte boundary (in the
                                x-direction). This flag should be set byapplications
                                that perform bitmap operations in windows by using
                                the BitBlt function.
           CS_CLASSDC           Gives the window class its owndisplay context (shared
                                by instances).   
           CS_DBLCLKS           Sends double-click messages to a window.   
           CS_GLOBALCLASS       Specifies that the window class isan application global
                                class. An application global class is created by an
                                application or library and is available to all
                                applications. The class is destroyed when the application
                                or library that created the class exits; it is essential,
                                therefore, that all windows created with the application
                                global class be closed before this occurs.
           CS_HREDRAW           Redraws the entire window if the horizontal size changes.   
           CS_NOCLOSE           Inhibits the close option on the System menu.   
           CS_OWNDC             Gives each window instance its own display context. Note
                                that although the CS_OWNDC style isconvenient, it must be
                                used with discretion because each display context occupies
                                approximately 800 bytes of memory.
           CS_PARENTDC          Gives the display context of the parent window to the
                                window class.   
           CS_SAVEBITS          Specifies that the system should try to save the screen
                                image behind a window created from this window class as a
                                bitmap. Later, when the window is removed, the system uses
                                the bitmap to quickly restore the screen image. This style
                                is useful for small windows that are displayed brieflyand
                                then removed before much other screen activity takes place
                                (for example, menus or dialog boxes). This style increases
                                the time required to display the window since the system
                                must first allocate memory to store the bitmap.
           CS_VREDRAW           Redraws the entire window if the vertical size changes.   
  <nClsExtra>  Specifies the number of bytes to allocate following the window class
               structure. These bytes are initialized to 0. 
  <nWndExtra>  Specifies the number of bytes to allocate following the window instance.
               Those bytes are initialized to 0. 
  <hCursor>    Identifies the class cursor. 
  <hBrush>     Identifies the class background brush. By default FiveWin assigns dark
               gray color brush. 
  <cMenuName>  Identifies the name of a resource menu. 
  <nWndProc>   A pointer to the window procedure. By default FiveWin uses DefWindowProc(). 
====== Devuelve ======
 <lSuccess> If the class is registered successfully. 

Observations:

 FiveWin manages all these functions automatically. We just provide here
its description with the intention that you get a better understanding,
but we insist on the idea that you let FiveWin manage all these.
