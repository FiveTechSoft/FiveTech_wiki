GetDC()

Retrieves the handle of a device context

====== Sintaxis ======
 GetDC( <hWnd> ) --> hDC 

 This function retrieves the handle of the device context of the client
area in the given window. 
====== Parámetros ======
 <hWnd> The handle of the window. 
====== Devuelve ======
 <hDC> The handle of the device context. 

Observations:

 You may think about a device context as a virtual screen. Something
similar when in MsDos we did DispBegin() and DispEnd() with Clipper. 

 GetDC() it is like DispBegin(). Starts working with a virtual screen.
ReleaseDC() it is like DispEnd(), and updates all painting to the visible
screen. 

 If you don't ReleaseDC() after you do a GetDC(), you are unbalancing
windows, and the system finally crash!
