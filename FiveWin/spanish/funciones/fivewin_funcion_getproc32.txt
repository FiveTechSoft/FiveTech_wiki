GetProc32()

It returns the address of a I module of 32 bits
====== Sintaxis ======
 GetProc32( <hInst>, <cProcName>, <lPascalType>, <nReturnType>,
[<nParam1Type>, ...<nParamNType>] ) --> cProcData 
====== Parámetros ======
  <hInst> Identifies the module that contains the function. Normally The
          handle of a DLL of 32 bits, that previously we have loaded with
          LoadLib32(). 
  <cProcName> The name of the function, or its order number inside the
          DLL. 
  <lPascalType> True is the function to be used is PASCAL type. Normally
          most of Windows API functions are PASCAL type. 
  <nReturnType> A numeric value that indicates the type of value returned
          by the function to be called. 
         The nReturnType possible values are inside FiveWin DLL.ch: 
           #define VOID      0 
           #define BYTE      1 
           #define CHAR      2 
           #define WORD      3 
           #define _INT      4   // conflicts with Clipper Int() 
           #define BOOL      5 
           #define HDC      6 
           #define LONG      7 
           #define STRING      8 
           #define LPSTR      9 
           #define PTR      10 
           #define _DOUBLE   11   // conflicts with BORDER DOUBLE 
  <nParam1Type> <nParamNType> Are the different types of Parameters that
         will be supplied as Parameters when calling to the DLL function. They are
         numeric values as the above <nReturnType> values. 
====== Devuelve ======
 <cProcData> A string which contains a binary representation of the DLL
function to be called plus necessary information about the type,
Parameters and return type. 

 The information here contained is vital to properly build a C-language
alike stack and its manipulation. 

Observations:

 This function is automatically used from the FiveWin DLL management
xBase commands. We strongly recommend to use the xBase commands to use
this function, as An easier way and avoid possible mistakes.
