Plays a WAV sound file



====== Sintaxis ======





 SndPlaySound( <cSndName>, <nMode> ) --> lSuccess 


 


 



====== Parámetros ======



 


 


 <cSndName> Specifies the name of the sound to play. The function
searches the [sounds] section of WIN.INI for an entry with this name and
plays the associated waveform file. If no entry by this name exists, then
it assumes the name is the name of a waveform file. If this parameter is
0, any currently playing sound is stopped. 


 


 


 


 <nMode> Specifies options for playing the sound using one or more of the
following flags: 


 


 



SND_SYNC      The sound is played synchronously and the function does not
return until the sound ends.   
SND_ASYNC      The sound is played asynchronously and the function
returns immediately after beginning the sound. To terminate an
asynchronously-played sound, call sndPlaySound with cSndName set to 0.
SND_NODEFAULT   If the sound can't be found, the function returns
silently without playing the default sound.   
SND_MEMORY      The parameter specified by cSndName to an in-memory image
of a waveform sound.   
SND_LOOP      The sound will continue to play repeatedly until
sndPlaySound is called again with the cSndName parameter set to 0. You
must also specify the SND_ASYNC flag to loop sounds.
SND_NOSTOP      If a sound is currently playing, the function will
immediately return FALSE without playing the requested sound.   







#define SND_SYNC      0   
#define SND_ASYNC      1   
#define SND_NODEFAULT   2   
#define SND_MEMORY      4   
#define SND_LOOP      8   
#define SND_NOSTOP      16
