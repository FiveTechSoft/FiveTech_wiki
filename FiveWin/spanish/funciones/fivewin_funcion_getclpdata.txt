GetClpData()

Retrieves the handle of the current clipboard data
====== Sintaxis ======
 GetClpData( <nFormat> ) --> cData 

 This function retrieves the containts of the ClipBoard. FiveWin, right
now, only supports text manipulation through the Clipboard (though it is
not a FiveWin limitation, just because we did not have the time yet! <g>)
