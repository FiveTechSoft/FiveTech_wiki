====== Clase TLinkList ======

Managing Linked-Lists data structures                                          
FiveWin implements a Class TLinkList to manage 'trees'. Trees are a            
visual representation of Linked-Lists data structures. Using a TWBrowse        
object we can visually represent the Link-List structure as a tree where       
each leave is a TTreeItem object.                                              
Windows 95 implements its own 'Tree' control, but thanks to Class              
TLinkList and Class TTreeItem (and using a TWBrowse object) we may use         
trees under Windows 3.1 and NT 3.51.                                           
See xBase TREE ... ENDTREE explanation to understand how to create a tree      
object. Once the tree is created, you may visualize it using the TWBrowse      
Method SetTree                                                                 
(oTree ):                                                                      
<oBrw>:SetTree( <oTree> )
