If you have never design a NetWork application with Clipper, don't be afraid! They are not so difficult. There are some rules you have to follow:


1.	All DataBases will be opened 'SHARED' by default, except if you specify 'EXCLUSIVE' clause, and also depending on your SET EXCLUSIVE ... state (see USE... and SET EXCLUSIVE... Clipper commands).



2.	Once the DataBase is USEd as SHARED, several users on a NetWork may use it, or several non-modal MdiChild windows or Non-modal DialogBoxes may access the DataBase info at the same time.



3.	You can not manipulate the contents of a field directly. Before replacing the value of a field you have to lock the record. Basically this is the typical procedure:


<code clipper>
if MyAlias->( RLock() )			// Lock the record

MyAlias->Field := <NewValue>	// Modify the contents
MyAlias->( DbUnLock() )		// UnLock the record

else

MsgAlert( "The DataBase is in use now! Try again!" )

endif

</code>

4.	Some Database operations (as building an entire INDEX) may require that you open a DataBase in EXCLUSIVE mode or that you lock the entire Database, not just a record.



Use USE ... EXCLUSIVE to open a DataBase as exclusive or use the function FLock() to entirely lock a file.



5.	Get yourself some book about NetWork coding for learning advanced tips and tricks! You will become a NetWork programming master pretty soon!
