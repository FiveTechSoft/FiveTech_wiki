====== Set Multiple ======

**Running multiple instances of a FiveWin EXE (only woks under Win 3.1) **

<code clipper> SET MULTIPLE [ ON | OFF ]  </code>

In 32 bits the same can be achieved by using the following code
<code clipper>
// Check whether the application is already running in the same PC
if IsExeRunning( cFileName( HB_ARGV( 0 ) ) )
   MsgWait( "Another instance of this application is already running in this PC", "Multiple Instance not allowed" )
   Return NIL
endif
</code>
