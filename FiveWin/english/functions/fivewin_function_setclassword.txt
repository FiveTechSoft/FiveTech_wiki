====== SetClassWord() ======


Changes a window word value



====== Syntax ======





 SetClassWord( <hWnd>, <nIndex>, <nNewValue> ) --> nOldValue 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <hWnd> The handle of the window 


 


 


 


 <nIndex> Specifies the zero-based byte offset of the word value to
change. 


 


 


 


 Valid values are in the range zero through the number of bytes of class
memory, minus two (for example, if 10 or more bytes of extra class memory
were specified, a value of 8 would be an index to the fifth integer), or
one of the following values: 


 


 



Value       Meaning   
GCW_HBRBACKGROUND   Sets a new handle of a background brush.   
GCW_HCURSOR      Sets a new handle of a cursor.   
GCW_HICON         Sets a new handle of an icon.   
GCW_STYLE         Sets a new style bit for the window class.   





 #define GCW_HBRBACKGROUND   (-10) 


 


 #define GCW_HCURSOR      (-12) 


 


 #define GCW_HICON         (-14) 


 


 #define GCW_HMODULE      (-16) 


 


 #define GCW_CBWNDEXTRA      (-18) 


 


 #define GCW_CBCLSEXTRA      (-20) 


 


 #define GCL_WNDPROC      (-24) 


 


 #define GCW_STYLE         (-26) 


 


 





 <nNewValue> Specifies the replacement value. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <nOldValue> The return value is the previous value of the specified
word, if the function is successful. Otherwise, it is zero. 


 


 



Observations:





 The SetClassWord function sets a word value at the specified offset into
the extra class memory for the window class to which the given window
belongs. Extra class memory is reserved by specifying a nonzero value in
the cbClsExtra member of the WNDCLASS structure used with the
RegisterClass function.
