======  GlobalAlloc() ====== 






Allocates a number of bytes from the global heap.



====== Syntax ======





 GlobalAlloc( <nType>, <nSize> ) --> hMem 


 


 



====== Parameters ======




   <nType>


GHND            Combines the GMEM_MOVEABLE and GMEM_ZEROINIT flags.   
GMEM_DDESHARE      Allocates sharable memory. This flag is used for
dynamic data exchange (DDE) only. This flag is equivalent to GMEM_SHARE. 
 
GMEM_DISCARDABLE      Allocates discardable memory. This flag can only be
used with the GMEM_MOVEABLE flag.   
GMEM_FIXED         Allocates fixed memory. The GMEM_FIXED and
GMEM_MOVEABLE flags cannot be combined.   
GMEM_LOWER      Same as GMEM_NOT_BANKED. This flag is ignored in Windows
3.1.   
GMEM_MOVEABLE      Allocates movable memory. The GMEM_FIXED and
GMEM_MOVEABLE flags cannot be combined.   
GMEM_NOCOMPACT      Does not compact or discard memory to satisfy the
allocation request.   
GMEM_NODISCARD      Does not discard memory to satisfy the allocation
request.   
GMEM_NOT_BANKED      Allocates non-banked memory (memory is not within
the memory provided by expanded memory). This flag cannot be used with
the GMEM_NOTIFY flag. This flagis ignored in Windows 3.1.
GMEM_NOTIFY      Calls the notification routine if the memory object is
discarded.   
GMEM_SHARE         Allocates memory that can be shared with other
applications. This flag is equivalent to GMEM_DDESHARE.   
GMEM_ZEROINIT      Initializes memory contents to zero.   
GPTR            Combines the GMEM_FIXED and GMEM_ZEROINIT flags.

 <nSize> Size of the memory allocated. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 Handle of the newly allocated global memory 


 


 


 


 If this function is successful, it allocates at least the amount
requested. If the amount allocated is greater than the amount requested,
the application can use the entire amount. To determine the size of a
global memory object, anapplication can use the GlobalSize function.To
free a global memory object, an application should use the GlobalFree
function. To change the size or attributes of an allocated memory object,
an application can use the GlobalReAlloc function. The largest memory
object that an application can allocate on an 80286 processor is 1
megabyte less 80 bytes. The largest block on an 80386 processor is 16
megabytes less 64K.
