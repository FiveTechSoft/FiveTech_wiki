OemToAnsi()






Translates a OEM MsDos string into a Windows string



====== Syntax ======





 OemToAnsi( <cOemText> ) --> cWindowText 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <cOemText> A OEM MsDOs string to be converted into a Windows string. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <cWindowText> The result Windows string. 


 


 



Observations:





 Normally all the data that you capture from MsDos into a DBF is stored
as OEM text. In this situation you may call OemToAnsi() to properly
review it from inside Windows. 


 


 


 


 Text that is captured from Windows is in Ansi format. To use it from
MsDos later, store it as the result of AnsiToOem().
