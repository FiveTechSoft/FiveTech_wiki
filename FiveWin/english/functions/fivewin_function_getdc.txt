======  GetDC() ====== 
Retrieves the handle of a device context. This function retrieves the handle of the device context of the client area in the given window. 

**Note:**

You can consider device context as a virtual screen. Something similar when in MsDos we did DispBegin() and DispEnd() with Clipper. 

GetDC() it is like DispBegin(). Starts working with a virtual screen. ReleaseDC() it is like DispEnd(), and updates all painting to the visible screen. 

If you don't ReleaseDC() after you do a GetDC(), you are unbalancing windows, and the system will finally crash!
