====== SndPlayResource() ======



Plays a WAV sound file from resources



====== Syntax ======





 SndPlayRes( <cSndName>, <nMode> ) --> lSuccess 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <cSndName> Specifies the name of the sound stored at resources to play.
It may be a string or a numeric identifier. To include a WAV file into an
RC, you must specify a new user defined resource type named "WAVE": 


 


 





 MyApp.rc 


 


 


 


 OKSOUND WAVE "OkSound.wav" 


 


 NOSOUND WAVE "NoSound.wav" 


 


 


 


 or 


 


 


 


 110 WAVE "OkSound.wav" 


 


 120 WAVE "NoSound.wav" 


 


 





 <nMode> Specifies options for playing the sound using one or more of the
following flags: 


 


 



SND_SYNC      The sound is played synchronously and the function does not
return until the sound ends.   
SND_ASYNC      The sound is played asynchronously and the function
returns immediately after beginning the sound. To terminate an
asynchronously-played sound, call sndPlaySound with cSndName set to 0.
SND_NODEFAULT   If the sound can't be found, the function returns
silently without playing the default sound.   
SND_MEMORY      The parameter specified by cSndName to an in-memory image
of a waveform sound.   
SND_LOOP      The sound will continue to play repeatedly until
sndPlaySound is called again with the cSndName parameter set to 0. You
must also specify the SND_ASYNC flag to loop sounds.
SND_NOSTOP      If a sound is currently playing, the function will
immediately return FALSE without playing the requested sound.   



#define SND_SYNC      0   
#define SND_ASYNC      1   
#define SND_NODEFAULT   2   
#define SND_MEMORY      4   
#define SND_LOOP      8   
#define SND_NOSTOP      16
