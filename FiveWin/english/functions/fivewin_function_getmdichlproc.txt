======  GetMDIChlProc() ====== 




Processor of messages for defect for MDIChild



====== Syntax ======





 GetMDIChlProc() --> nlPointer 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 None 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 It returns the procedure that manages the messages that the window
MDIChild doesn't manage explicitly. The messages of window that
expecificamente is not processed by the one procedure DefWindowProc will
spend to DefMDIChildProc. 


 


 



Observations





 All the messages that a window doesn't process are passed to the
function for defect so that it processes them (DefWinProc). When instead
of with a normal window we work with windows MDI the procedures call
themselves of different it forms: DefFrameProc and DefMDIChildProc. Our
function obtains the procedure DefMDIChildProc. Summarizing is as a curl
do case... endcase that was treating the possible messages of a window
and if after checking all the messages doesn't find it it would use the
action specified in " otherwise ".
