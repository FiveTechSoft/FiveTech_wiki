====== SysRefresh() ======

Lets Windows process all pending messages



====== Syntax ======





 SysRefresh() --> lQuit 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 None. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <lQuit> A logical value indicating if a WM_QUIT message was issued, so
the app should be finished. 


 


 



Observations:





 This FiveWin function is extremelly important and has no counterpart in
standard Windows API. 


 


 


 


 SysRefresh() processes all pending messages, letting Windows keep
controlling all its pending activities. 


 


 


 


 We must use SysRefresh() from inside those processes that may be time
consuming. 


 


 


 


 The big benefit and advantadge of SysRefresh() is that it lets us keep
doing 'standard' linear programming without having to send ourselves
messages to keep processing a long task. 


 


 


 


 Use it in loops, seeks, and any time consuming processes to avoid
Windows from losing processing control.
