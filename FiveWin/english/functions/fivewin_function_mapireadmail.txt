 Previous  Top  Next

Retrieves a message for reading.

====== Syntax ======

 


 MAPIReadMail( [<cMsgId>], [<nFlags>] ) --> aRet 


 


 
====== Parameters ======


 <cMsgId> The message id. 


 


 

 <nFlags> The following flags can be set: 


 


 MAPI_BODY_AS_FILE 


 


 MAPIReadMail should write the message text to a temporary file and add
it as the first attachment in the attachment list. 


 


 MAPI_ENVELOPE_ONLY 


 


 MAPIReadMail should read the message header only. File attachments are
not copied to temporary files, and neither temporary file names nor
message text is written. Setting this flag enhances performance. 


 


 MAPI_PEEK 


 


 MAPIReadMail does not mark the message as read. Marking a message as
read affects its appearance in the user interface and generates a read
receipt. If the messaging system does not support this flag, MAPIReadMail
always marks the message as read. If MAPIReadMail encounters an error, it
leaves the message unread. 


 


 MAPI_SUPPRESS_ATTACH 


 


 MAPIReadMail should not copy file attachments but should write message
text into the MapiMessage structure. MAPIReadMail ignores this flag if
the calling application has set the MAPI_ENVELOPE_ONLY flag. Setting the
MAPI_SUPPRESS_ATTACH flag enhances performance. 


 

 


 
====== Returns ======


 <aRet> An array containing Subject, NoteText, Type, Date, Flags,
Recipient, Originator.
