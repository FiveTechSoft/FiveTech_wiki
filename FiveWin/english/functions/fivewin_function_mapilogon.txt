MAPILogon()
 Previous  Top  Next

Begins a Simple MAPI session, loading the default message store and
address book providers.

====== Syntax ======

 


 MAPILogon( [<cUsername>], [<cPassword>], [<nFlags>] ) --> nRetCode 


 


 
====== Parameters ======


 <cUsername> The username. 


 


 <cPassword> The password. 


 


 

 <nFlags> The following flags can be set: 


 


 MAPI_FORCE_DOWNLOAD 


 


 An attempt should be made to download all of the user's messages before
returning. If the MAPI_FORCE_DOWNLOAD flag is not set, messages can be
downloaded in the background after the function call returns. 


 


 MAPI_NEW_SESSION 


 


 An attempt should be made to create a new session rather than acquire
the environment's shared session. If the MAPI_NEW_SESSION flag is not
set, MAPILogon uses an existing shared session. 


 


 MAPI_LOGON_UI 


 


 A logon dialog box should be displayed to prompt the user for logon
information. If the user needs to provide a password and profile name to
enable a successful logon, MAPI_LOGON_UI must be set. 


 


 MAPI_PASSWORD_UI 


 


 MAPILogon should only prompt for a password and not allow the user to
change the profile name. Either MAPI_PASSWORD_UI or MAPI_LOGON_UI should
not be set, since the intent is to select between two different dialog
boxes for logon. 


 

 


 
====== Returns ======


 <nRetCode> The return code: 


 


 

 MAPI_E_FAILURE 


 


 

 One or more unspecified errors occurred during logon. No session handle
was returned. 


 


 

 MAPI_E_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY 


 


 

 There was insufficient memory to proceed. No session handle was
returned. 


 


 

 MAPI_E_LOGIN_FAILURE 


 


 

 There was no default logon, and the user failed to log on successfully
when the logon dialog box was displayed. No session handle was returned. 


 


 

 MAPI_E_TOO_MANY_SESSIONS 


 


 

 The user had too many sessions open simultaneously. No session handle
was returned. 


 


 

 MAPI_E_USER_ABORT 


 


 

 The user canceled the logon dialog box. No session handle was returned. 


 


 

 SUCCESS_SUCCESS 


 


 

 The call succeeded and a Simple MAPI session was established.
