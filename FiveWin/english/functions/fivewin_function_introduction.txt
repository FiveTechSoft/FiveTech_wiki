Here is a list of all FiveWin currently defined functions.

We provide this list with the intention that no part of FiveWin gets
undocumented, but we want clearly to warn you that IT IS NOT NECESSARY AT
ALL to know all these functions because most of them are automatically
called and managed from higher level FiveWin classes and xBase commands.

Try to keep yourself at the xBase commands level and Objects and Classes
level and your productivity will benefit very much.

Most of these functions are specific to Windows API and most of them have
their equivalents into other graphical environments like Linux, Mac, etc.
That is why in our opinion the real important thing is that you
understand all the processes that get involved when you are working in a
graphical environment. But never focus on the details. They will be
changing always.

Keeping this object oriented point of view, you get the freedom of moving
to any graphical environment and you will still understand all the
working processes. This is why FiveWin has its equivalent in Linux
FiveLinux and in MsDos FiveDos, or even we plan to port it to other
environments like Mac.

Of course, some knowledge of this functions will give you sometimes a
better understanding. If you want and have the time to get a 100%
understanding then we strongly recommend reviewing Borland's C++ HLP file
or Microsoft C++ help (or any other Windows compilers manufacturer). But
remember, have your application built in time! That's the main thing.
