====== MoveTo() ======


Changes the painting coordinates



====== Syntax ======





 MoveTo( <hDC>, <nCol>, <nRow> ) --> nLOldPos 


 


 



====== Parameters ======



 


 


 <hDC> The handle of the device context where where are going to paint. 


 


 


 


 <nCol>, <nRow> The coordinates where to start painting. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <nLOldPos> A numeric LONG ( four bytes ) value that stores the old
position. The LOWORD( <nLOldValue> ) contains the old nCol and the
HIWORD( <nLOldValue> ) contains the old nRow. 


 


 



Observations:





 Some API GDI painting functions requires to previously determinate the
position where to start painting. MoveTo() lets do that.
