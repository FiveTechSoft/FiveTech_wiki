====== DibDraw() ======
FiveWin DIB drawing function.  This function draws a DIB (device independent bitmap) on the device
context specified by hDC. 

**Notes :**

When we started building FiveWin we first started working with bitmaps.
Later we discovered that the general recommendation was to work with
DIBs. So we developed all the necessary functions to work with DIBs. As
our own experience increased, we believe that there is a better way (a
mixture of both) that was much faster and easier. 

We did a lot of different tests, and our system was by far the fastest.
It was a reason based on speed and ease of use, because we wanted FiveWin
to be extremely fast!  

The later system is the one we currently use in FiveWin, though we do
give support for both Bitmaps and DIBs. 

You don't have to worry at all, just use FiveWin TBitmap Class and place
yourself at the xBase & OOP level to get the maximum productivity. 

Concentrate on your application, don't lose yourself in details!

|<nRow>, <nCol>| The coordinates in pixels where the drawing to start.|
|<nWidth>, <nHeight>| The dimensions for drawing the DIB.|
|<nRasterOp>| Specifies the raster operation to be performed (see BitBlt()).|
