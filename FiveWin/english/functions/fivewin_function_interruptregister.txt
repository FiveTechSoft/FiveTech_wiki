Installs a user defined GPFs controller

====== Syntax ======


 InterruptRegister( <bAction> ) --> lSuccess 


 

====== Parameters ======


 <bAction> Codeblock to execute at GPF. 


 

====== Returns ======


 <lSuccess> A logical value indicating if the GPF controller was properly
installed. 


 

Comments:


 Though FiveWin has been extensively tested against GPFs, we wanted to
offer control over a possible GPF offering so an opportunity to take
control to close all files and generating an error.log file with info to
detect the cause.
