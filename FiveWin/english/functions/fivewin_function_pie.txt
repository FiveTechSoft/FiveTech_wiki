Pie()






Draws a graphic pie



====== Syntax ======





 Pie( <hDC>, <nLeftRect>, <nTopRect>, <nRightRect>, <nBottomRect>,
<nxStartArc>, <nyStartArc>, <nxEndArc>, <nyEndArc> ) --> lSuccess 


 


 



Parameters



 


 


 <hDC> Handle of device context 


 


 


 


 <nLeftRect> x-coordinate upper-left corner bounding rectangle 


 


 


 


 <nTopRect> y-coordinate upper-left corner bounding rectangle 


 


 


 


 <nRightRect> x-coordinate lower-right corner bounding rectangle 


 


 


 


 <nBottomRect> y-coordinate lower-right corner bounding rectangle 


 


 


 


 <nxStartArc> x-coordinate arc starting point 


 


 


 


 <nyStartArc> y-coordinate arc starting point 


 


 


 


 <nxEndArc> x-coordinate arc ending point 


 


 


 


 


 <nyEndArc> y-coordinate arc ending point 


 


 


 


 


 


 The Pie function draws a pie-shaped wedge by drawing an elliptical arc
whose center and two endpoints are joined by lines. 


 


 



Returns





 <lSuccess> A logical value indicating if the operation was successfull. 


 


 



Comments





 The center of the arc drawn by the Pie function is the center of the
bounding rectangle specified by the nLeftRect, nTopRect, nRightRect, and
nBottomRect parameters. The starting and ending points of the arc are
specified by the nxStartArc, nyStartArc, nxEndArc, and nyEndArc
parameters. The function draws the arc by using the selected pen, moving
in a counterclockwise direction. It then draws two additional lines from
each endpoint to the arc's center. Finally, it fills the pie-shaped area
by using the current brush. 


 


 


 


 


 If nxStartArc equals nxEndArc and nyStartArc equals nyEndArc, the result
is an ellipse with a single line from the center of the ellipse to the
point (nxStartArc,nyStartArc) or (nxEndArc,nyEndArc). 


 


 


 


 The figure drawn by this function extends up to but does not include the
right and bottom coordinates. This means that the height of the figure is
nBottomRect - nTopRect and the width of the figure is nRightRect -
nLeftRect. 


 


 


 


 Both the width and the height of a rectangle must be greater than 2
units and less than 32,767 units.
