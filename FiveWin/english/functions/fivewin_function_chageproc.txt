Changes the procedure of a Window



====== Syntax ======





 ChangeProc( <hWnd> ) --> nOldProc 


 


 





 This function replaces the procedure that controls the behavior of a
function, for a FiveWin special one. 


 


 


 


 RestProc() replaces again this new procedure for the old one. 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <hWnd> The handle of the window to change its proc. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <nOldProc> A number ( long pointer ) of the old procedure. 


 


 



Observations





 This function is used internally by FiveWin to automatically subclass
windows and controls and to make them compatible with the OOPS
architecture of FiveWin.
