====== GetMapMode() ====== 
 





Retrieves the current mapping mode



====== Syntax ======





 GetMapMode( <hDC> ) --> nMapMode 


 


 





 The function retrieves the current mapping mode for a given device
context. 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <hDC> The handle of the device context. 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 <nMapMode> A numeric value of the followings: 


 


 



MM_ANISOTROPIC   Logical units are converted to arbitrary units with
arbitrarily scaled axes. Setting the mapping mode to MM_ANISOTROPIC does
not change the current window or viewport settings. To change the units,
orientation, and scaling, an application should use the SetWindowExt and
SetViewportExt functions.
MM_HIENGLISH   Each logical unit is converted to 0.001 inch. Positive x
is to the right; positive y is up.   
MM_HIMETRIC      Each logical unit is converted to 0.01 millimeter.
Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.   
MM_ISOTROPIC   Logical units are converted to arbitrary units with
equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is equal to one
unit along the y-axis. The SetWindowExt and SetViewportExt functions must
be used to specify the desired units and the orientation of the axes. GDI
makes adjustments as necessary to ensure that the x and y units remain
the same size.
MM_LOENGLISH   Each logical unit is converted to 0.01 inch. Positive x is
to the right; positive y is up.   
MM_LOMETRIC   Each logical unit is converted to 0.1 millimeter. Positive
x is to the right; positive y is up.   
MM_TEXT      Each logical unit is converted to one device pixel. Positive
x is to the right; positive y is down.   
MM_TWIPS      Each logical unit is converted to 1/20 of a point. (Because
a point is 1/72 inch, a twip is 1/1440 inch). Positive x is to the right;
positive y is up.
