====== GetWindow() ====== 


Retrieves a handle to a window that has the specified relationship to the
specified window.

====== Syntax ======

 


 GetWindow( <hWnd>, <nRelationShip> ) --> hWnd 


 


 
====== Parameters ======


 <hWnd> Handle to a window. 


 


 <nRelationShip> Specifies the relationship between the specified window
and the window whose handle is to be retrieved. This parameter can be one
of the following values: 


 


 
GW_CHILD      The retrieved handle identifies the child window at the top
of the Z order, if the specified window is a parent window; otherwise,
the retrieved handle is NULL. The function examines only child windows of
the specified window. It does not examine descendant windows.
GW_ENABLEDPOPUP   Windows 2000: The retrieved handle identifies the
enabled popup window owned by the specified window (the search uses the
first such window found using GW_HWNDNEXT); otherwise, if there are no
enabled popup windows, the retrieved handle is that of the specified
window.
GW_HWNDFIRST   The retrieved handle identifies the window of the same
type that is highest in the Z order. If the specified window is a topmost
window, the handle identifies the topmost window that is highest in the Z
order. If the specified window is a top-level window, the handle
identifies the top-level window that is highest in the Z order. If the
specified window is a child window, the handle identifies the sibling
window that is highest in the Z order.
GW_HWNDLAST   The retrieved handle identifies the window of the same type
that is lowest in the Z order. If the specified window is a topmost
window, the handle identifies the topmost window that is lowest in the Z
order. If the specified window is a top-level window, the handle
identifies the top-level window that is lowest in the Z order. If the
specified window is a child window, the handle identifies the sibling
window that is lowest in the Z order.
GW_HWNDNEXT   The retrieved handle identifies the window below the
specified window in the Z order. If the specified window is a topmost
window, the handle identifies the topmost window below the specified
window. If the specified window is a top-level window, the handle
identifies the top-level window below the specified window. If the
specified window is a child window, the handle identifies the sibling
window below the specified window.
GW_HWNDPREV   The retrieved handle identifies the window above the
specified window in the Z order. If the specified window is a topmost
window, the handle identifies the topmost window above the specified
window. If the specified window is a top-level window, the handle
identifies the top-level window above the specified window. If the
specified window is a child window, the handle identifies the sibling
window above the specified window.
GW_OWNER      The retrieved handle identifies the specified window's
owner window, if any.

 


 
====== Returns ======


 <hWnd> If the function succeeds, the return value is a window handle. If
no window exists with the specified relationship to the specified window,
the return value is NULL.
