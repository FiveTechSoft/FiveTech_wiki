Enables or disables WM_COMMNOTIFY message posting to the given window


====== Syntax ======        


EnableCommNotification(<nComDev>,; <hWnd>,; <nInBytes>,; <nOutBytes>  ) -->lSucces

If an application specifies -1 for the nInBytes parameter, the WM_COMMNOTIFY message is sent to the specified window for CN_EVENT and CN_TRANSMIT notifications but not for CN_RECEIVE notifications. If -1 is specified for the nOutBytes CN_EVENT and CN_RECEIVE notifications are sent but CN_TRANSMIT notifications are not.

If a timeout occurs before as many bytes as specified by the nInBytes parameter are written to the input queue, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message is sent with the CN_RECEIVE flag set. When this occurs, another message will not be sent until the n bytes in the input queue falls below the number specified in the nInBytes parameter. Similarly, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message in which the CN_RECEIVE flag is set is sent only when the output queue is larger than the number of bytes specified nOutBytes parameter.

====== Parameters ======


| <nComDev>   Communications-device identifier |

| <hWnd>   Handle of window receiving messages |

| <nInBytes>   Number of bytes written before notification |

| <nOutBytes>   Mimum number of bytes in output queue |

====== Returns ======         


| Retrives .t. if the function is successful. |
