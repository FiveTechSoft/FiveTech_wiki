Selects the kind of text aligment



====== Syntax ======





 SetTextAlign( <hDC>, <nAlignMode> ) --> nOldAlign 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <hDC> Identifies the device context. 


 


 


 


 <nAlignMode> A numeric value specifying the align mode: 


 


 


 


 The flags specify the relationship between a point and a rectangle that
bounds the text. The point can be either the current position or
coordinates specified by a text-output function (such as the ExtTextOut
function). The rectangle that bounds the text is defined by the adjacent
character cells in the text string. 


 


 


 


 The <nAlignMode> parameter can be one or more flags from the following
three categories. 


 


 


 Choose only one flag from each category. The first category affects text
alignment in the x-direction: 


 


 



Value         Meaning   
TA_CENTER      Aligns the point with the horizontal center of the
bounding rectangle.   
TA_LEFT      Aligns the point with the left side of the bounding
rectangle. This is the default setting.   
TA_RIGHT      Aligns the point with the right side of the bounding
rectangle.   









 The second category affects text alignment in they-direction: 


 


 





Value         Meaning   
TA_BASELINE      Aligns the point with the base line of the chosen font. 
 
TA_BOTTOM      Aligns the point with the bottom of the bounding
rectangle.   
TA_TOP      Aligns the point with the top of the bounding rectangle. This
is the default setting.   





 The third category determines whether the current position is updated
when text is written: 


 


 







Value         Meaning   
TA_NOUPDATECP   Does not update the current position after each call to a
text-output function. This is the default setting.   
TA_UPDATECP      Updates the current x-position after each call to a
text-output function. The new position is at the right side of the
bounding rectangle for the text. When this flag is set, the coordinates
specified in calls to the TextOut function are ignored.





====== Returns ======





 <nOldAlign> The previous text-alignment settings, if the function is
successful. 


 


 



Observations:





 This align flags are used by the TextOut() and ExtTextOut() functions.
