====== MoveGet() ======



Set the formatting rectangle of a multiline edit control



====== Syntax ======





 MoveGet( <hWnd> ) --> nil 


 


 



====== Parameters ======





 <hWnd> Handle of the control 


 


 



====== Returns ======





 Nil 


 


 



====== Example ======



Observations:





 It happens in occasions that when editing in a Get we write and it seems
as that there were two different areas in a same Get. We type and the
text gets lost beyond the limits of the edition box. This function is
capable of adjusting the edition area and the edition box corresponding.
