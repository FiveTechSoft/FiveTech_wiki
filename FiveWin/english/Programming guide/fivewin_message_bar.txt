The message bar has become also a standard component that we may find in almost all Windows applications.

A message bar is a control placed at the bottom of its container window that shows information related to the pulldown menu currently option selected or to the buttonbar button currently under the mouse cursor.

It is also possible to display the messages of a child Dialog Box controls, to help users to understand the meaning of each DialogBox control. (See DialogBoxes explanations.)

FiveWin automatically applies 3D look to the messagebar, and optionally lets selection of a left or center message position (see MessageBar xBase commands).

The next version of FiveWin will offer new and powerful possibilities for messagebar (like the ability of having multiples columns of information on it, and automatic timed messages).

In the source code of the FiveWin IDE you will find samples showing how to place a clock in the messagebar. We plan to extend FiveWin messagebar with all those features.

A well designed application that uses extensive information on the  messagebar to help the user quickly understand, reduces training times for companies and makes software much more human oriented.
