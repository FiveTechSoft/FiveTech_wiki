Besides the sophisticated FiveWin Report Engine, FiveWin offers you RAD (rapid application development) techniques to quickly prototype your printouts, with no work at all on your side!:

· Generating a full report from the current workarea:


Just call the function Report() and you will get a full paged report automatically generated from the current workarea!


· Generating an automatic report from any Browse !!!:


If you do <oBrw>:Report() where <oBrw> is a reference to your browse, FiveWin will generate a full report with the same contents of your browse. So, the easiest way to implement a report in your browse is placing a bitmap button on your DialogBox with the   action <oBrw>:Report().


· Making a printer HardCopy of any window or control !!!:


If you have a Dialog and you want to obtain a printout of it, the easiest way is just doing: <oDlg>:HardCopy( <nZoom> ) where <oDlg> is your Dialog object and <nZoom> is a scale factor - a value of 3 is normally recommended to obtain natural dimensions- You can use a bitmap instead of the Dialog, or any window or control!


Combining these techniques you can very quickly prototype your first application printouts. Don't forget them!

Remember to use these techniques on the first stages of your application.
