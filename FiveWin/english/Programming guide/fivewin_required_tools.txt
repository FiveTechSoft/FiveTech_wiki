Hardware requirements :

· FiveWin works from 386 computers and up. We do not support 286 computers.


· FiveWin may work in computers with 2 megs of RAM, though a minimum of 4 megs is highly recommended.

· FiveWin works in computers with DBLSPACE double spaced hard disks.

· FiveWin has been successfully tested with:

        - Windows 3.1
        - Windows 3.11 for WorkGroups
        - Windows 95
        - Windows NT
        - Windows 2000
        - Windows XP
        - Windows Vista
        - Windows 7

· FiveWin has been successfully tested in Windows for WorkGroups NetWork, Windows 95 NetWork, Windows NT NetWork and Novell Network.

Software requirements:

· CA-Clipper 5.01, CA-Clipper 5.2 or CA-Clipper 5.3.

· A Windows linker is required:


We highly recommend Blinker 3.0 and above versions. Blinker 3.XX is the Linker we normally use with our MsDos, Windows and IBM/OS2 Five versions.

· Microsoft LINK.EXE 5.10 version and above work fine with FiveWin:


· IBM/OS2 versions 2.1 and above supplies a version of Microsoft LINK that works fine with FiveWin.

· If you use LINK version 5.1 (the one provided with IBM/OS2) you need to use the SOURCE\TOOLS\ExeType.exe utility we provide to change the internal EXE version       generated by the LINKer:

ExeType.exe MyApp.exe 3.1   %%// Call this after generating the EXE%%

You may download the latest Microsoft link LINK.EXE directly from InterNet: ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/lnkXXX.exe

We do not support Borland's TLINK.EXE.

Symantec C++ 7.0 OptLink is compatible with FiveWin. C++ 6.0 version it is not compatible.


· A Windows Resource Editor is HIGHLY recommended. We normally use Borland's Resource WorkShop. We have also successfully tested Microsoft AppStudio resource editor. These tools come with Borland's C/C++ compiler or Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

See the following:


· It is highly recommended that you acquire Borland's Turbo C++ for Windows or Borland's C++ 3.1 or Borland's C++ 4.0 or above.

We normally use Borland C++ 3.1. And all the C code included in FiveWin has been developed using Borland C/C++ compiler.

Also, Microsoft Visual C++ is a highly recommended tool to acquire. Also we have tested with Symantec C++.

These products include excellent Windows Resources editors, that you need to do Visual programming.

These products offer a lot of very useful documentation, tools and of course, the C/C++ compiler, that you may use to enhance FiveWin developing new API C and DLLs C functions.

We do recommend you to acquire one of these compilers. They will offer you many, manbenefits.



===== Dos Coding and Windows Testing =====
Clipper programmers traditionally select certain tools to build their own workbench environments. These are the tools that we strongly recommend to be used in Windows programming:


|Source code editor	|MultiEdit for Windows (+ Evolve for Windows) \\ (c) American Cibernetics |
|File Manager |Windows Commander \\ (c) Christian Ghisler |
|Resource Editor |Borland's Resource WorkShop |
|Linker	|Blinker 3.3 and above (c) Blink Inc. |
|DataBases manager |Dbu for Windows  (c)OZ Soft www.ozs.com |

Clipper.EXE, Blinker.EXE and MsLink.EXE, are DOS EXEs, and they must be executed from within a Dos task.

Normally we keep one or two Windows MsDos tasks. Pressing Alt-TAB you may quickly switch from MsDos into Windows and vice versa. If you configure your Windows installation properly, you can direct all the  Windows normal activity swapping to a RamDisk, so the swapping to MsDos  and vice may be instant and without any hard disk activity.

We recommend you to create a Windows program manager new group, where  you place the icon of your FiveWin development application, plus an  icon for accessing MsDos, and another for the Windows resource editor  you use.

A great new benefit of Windows 95 is that you can automatically invoke  your Windows EXE from inside a MsDos task. So you may modify the  SAMPLES\BUILD.BAT we provide to automatically start your application  after linking it. So, no Alt-TAB pressing may be required to switch to  Windows.

We have compared our development cycle (editing-compiling-linking- testing) speed with other Windows development tools and platforms, and  we are proud to say, that by far, CA-Clipper and FiveWin are the  fastest Windows development tools for a professional programmer.
