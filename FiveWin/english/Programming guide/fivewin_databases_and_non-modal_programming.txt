If you choose to develop your application using a Non-modal style you may be aware of certain design rules:

**1. What is a Non-modal application ?
**

If you use MDI windows in your app, or if you use DialogBoxes with the clause NOWAIT, then you are implementing Non-modal designs.

A non-modal design will let user select several things at the same time. If you place a browse inside a MDIChild window, that MdiChild window may be opened several times! Or if a DialogBox is editing a certain Database, it may be issued several times.


**2. How a non-modal design affects my DataBases manipulation design ?
**

A non-modal design works exactly as if you were workin on a NetWork, so NetWork programming rules have to be used. If a MdiChild window opens several times (at the same time) the same DataBase it will be the same situation as if different users were being opening several times those Databases on a NetWork.

**3. Does Clipper offer DataBase capabilities for Non-modal programming ?
**

Yes! Clipper let you open the same physical database in different alias, though acting in the same way as if you were working on a NetWork.



//**Important**//:	In order to let Clipper manage the same DataBase on different alias, you HAVE to specify different ALIAS:

<code clipper>
USE Customer ALIAS Cust1 NEW
USE Customer ALIAS Cust2 NEW
</code>
 From that moment you have to use Cust1 or Cust2 to reference your fields.

**4. How difficult is coding for a NetWork ?
**

If you have never coded for a NetWork, don't be afraid. In next item in this documentation we explain the foundation for doing NetWork coding with Clipper. It is quite easy!
