2. You will be prompted for the name of the custom control to use: Write TWBrowse.

3. Draw the browse area on the Dialog Box and double click on it.

4. Add the following styles at the bottom:

<code clipper>
... | WS_TABSTOP | WS_BORDER | WS_VSCROLL | WS_HSCROLL
</code>

5. To check that everything is ok from inside the Resource WorkShop, select the PullDown menu option: "Edit as text"

   The text may show an entry like this:

<code clipper>

CONTROL "", 110, "TWBrowse", 0 | WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP | WS_VSCROLL | WS_BORDER, 4, 23, 117, 104

</code>
