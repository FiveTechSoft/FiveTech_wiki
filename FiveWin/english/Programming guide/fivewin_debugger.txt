FiveWin provides its own debugger. Simply use **/b** when compiling your PRGs and the debugger will appear automatically.

To test it, simply go to FWH\samples folder and type:

**buildh.bat tutor02 /b**

FiveWin also generates a very complete error.log file when an error occurs.  Please review it to find the error description, location, stack calls, etc. to find the error origin in your app.

We encourage to contact us on the tech support forums if you have a problem that you are unable to solve (instead of wasting precious time that you need for development). http://forums.fivetechsupport.com
