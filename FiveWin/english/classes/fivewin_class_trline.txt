====== Class TRLine ======

FiveWin Report Engine Line objects                                             
These objects are used by the TReport objects to keep some entire lines        
of the report as the header, footer and the title.\\ \\ A TRLine object keeps multiple lines of information, related just with         
one report object component. We call 'line element' to each element of the line.\\ \\ In a report it is possible to identify some vertical information 
(normally knowns as the report columns) and some other horizontal info which remains the same from page to page as the header, the footer and         
the title.\\ \\ Managing this report components as objects gives an extraordinary flexibility of using different fonts, etc...
