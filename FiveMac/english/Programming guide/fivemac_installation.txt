In order to install it, you have to run the following setup applications, once downloaded from FiveTech:


  * fivemac.zip (commercial)
  * Harbour.zip (free)

Alternatively you can download and build Harbour yourself: 

  * Download and build Harbour from its free repository [[Harbour_build|==>]]

Once you unzip FiveMac and Harbour, please go to FiveMac/samples folder and give execution permissions to build.sh:

   chmod +x build.sh

You may also need to give execution permissions to Harbour in Harbour/bin folder:

   chmod +x harbour
