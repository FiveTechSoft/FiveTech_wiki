====== Class TXBrowse ======

Class TXBrowse                                                                 
Inherits from TControl                                                         
This control intends to substitute completely all the previous Browse          
control developed by FiveTech. Due his complexity there are no commands        
available to use, but in his counterpart there are not functions or            
methods that receive an enormous quantity of parameters.                       
The first thing you should be aware is that the construction of the            
control is done in two phases:                                                 
�      Creation of the TXBrowse control                                        
�      Creation of the Windows API control based on the TXBrowse control       
====== DATA ======
|This|modification has been done in order to let the programmer the|
|assignment|of any object property before the window is truly created. For|
|example,|you may disable a scrollbar easily just changing the data|
|lVScroll|or lHScroll before the window is created.|
|As|usual on all Fivewin controls the creation of the object is done with|
|constructor|'New' which now only receives one parameter which its|
|container|window:|
|oMyBrw|:= TXBrowse():New( oWnd )|
|Afterwards|you can change any property of the control, adding columns to|
|it,|etcetera. When the entire configuration has been made then you call|
|the|window creation method which can be:|
|�|CreateFromCode|
|�|CreateFromResource( nId )|
|The|methods name are self explanatory, the first one creates a TXBrowse|
|window|as you would done with the typical '@ nRow, nCol' and the second|
|one|is used when creating the control from resources and you give as|
|parameter|just the ID of the control.|
|The|TXBrowse class also uses another class for his columns with the name|
|TXBrwColumn,|to add a new column to the TXBrowse object you only need to|
|call|the method 'AddCol'|
|oCol|:= oBrw:AddCol()|
|The|TXBrowse control internally calls the method 'Adjust' when is|
|completely|created. This method is the responsible of calculating the|
|dimension|of every column data, header and footer and adjusts the browse|
|adequately.|The method 'Adjust' is also present on every column object|
|and|is also called within TXBrowse 'Adjust' method. The method 'Adjust'|
|only|modifies the properties of the object if they were 'nil' before the|
|method|is called. So if you call the method 'Adjust' manually you should|
|be|aware that you also will need to assign to 'nil' all the properties|
|that|you want to be recalculated like for example the header height.|
|We|highly recommend looking at the sample Testxbrw.prg to gain a better|
|understanding|of the TXBrowse control.|
