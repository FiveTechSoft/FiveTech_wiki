Note: The data lAdjust is not supported because now the bitmaps background color is automatically adjusted to his window or control conteiner. The pixel 0,0 (Left-Top) indicates the mask color to use for the adjustment. It is important that the color in that pixel is not used on any other part of the bitmap except where the mask should be applied. This kind of color adjustment is not possible with bitmap streching
