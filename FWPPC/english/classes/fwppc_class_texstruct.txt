====== Class TExStruct ======

Fivewin Structures                                                             
These Class has some benefits over the TStruc class, wich are:                 
- Structures can be nested                                                     
- A member of a structure can be of any data type                              
- Length and type of the members is optional                                   
Because the two classes use the same syntax is important that you do not       
mix                                                                            
bouth on the same PRG file.                                                    
TStruc should be used when you need 'C' like structures that can be used       
to call any external DLL, TExStruc can be used in the rest of cases.
